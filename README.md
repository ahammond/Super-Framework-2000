Add a README
============

No, seriously already
---------------------

The basic syntax is here

http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax

Github deviates as follows

http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/

Which I think are sensible changes for markdown oriented towards code.

Content
-------

Your README should give basic instructions to build and use the library.

If you have a demo app, that should probably be in a separate directory
with it's own README that describes build instructions and runs through
how the code works.
